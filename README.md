# Size Spectra Work for Pelagic Community Structure

This repository is focused on our size spectra research within the Pelagic Community Structure working group. The project, Interannual variability and long term change in pelagic community structure across a latitudinal gradient, examines how pelagic marine ecosystems respond to both cyclic and long-term changes. We use comparative data from multiple LTER sites to test and refine conceptual models of community responses to these changes. 

## About This Repository

This repository specifically contains scripts and calculations related to Normalized Biomass Size Spectra (NBSS) for zooplankton collected during Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) cruises. 

## Scripts and Calculations

This repository contains the R scripts used to compute size spectra for zooplankton sampled during NES-LTER cruises. These scripts include necessary calculations and conversions to obtain Equivalent Spherical Diameter (ESD) measurements.
